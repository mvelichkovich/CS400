It is 3020 and Ally is waiting to get back from school so that she can open her birthday present. When she gets home she see's an extremely 
large box in the kitchen. She runs over to open it... it's a robot! She has been asking her parents for the newest robot-buddy all year and can't
wait to start playing with it. However, after a few days she starts to notice something weird about the robot.
