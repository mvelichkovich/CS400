It is 3020 and Ally is waiting to get back from school so that she can open her birthday present. When she gets home she see's an extremely 
large box in the kitchen. She runs over to open it... it's a robot! She has been asking her parents for the newest robot-buddy all year and can't
wait to start playing with it. However, after a few days she starts to notice something weird about the robot.

Aaron Stephenson's paragraph:
Each day she starts noticing a new strange activity by the robot. She thinks it has been trying her clothes on and her hairbrush is missing too. 
It even started to act funny too giving her addituide at times and not wanting to hang out with her all the time. She tries to figure out why it's stuaring to act that way but can't really figure it out. She's a little worried but igores it for the most part.
