It is 3020 and Ally is waiting to get back from school so that she can open her birthday present. When she gets home she see's an extremely 
large box in the kitchen. She runs over to open it... it's a robot! She has been asking her parents for the newest robot-buddy all year and can't
wait to start playing with it. However, after a few days she starts to notice something weird about the robot.

Aaron Stephenson's paragraph:
Each day she starts noticing a new strange activity by the robot. She thinks it has been trying her clothes on and her hairbrush is missing too. 
It even started to act funny too giving her addituide at times and not wanting to hang out with her all the time. She tries to figure out why it's stuaring to act that way but can't really figure it out. She's a little worried but igores it for the most part.

  One morning, Ally woke up to find the robot hunched over her face, staring at her. "AHHH!", she screamed.  Fed up, Ally decides to ask the question that has been bugging her for the last few days. "Why have you been acting so strange lately? I know you've stolen by hairbrush and have been trying out my clothes." The robot simply stared blankly in silence. "Okay, I've had enough of this.  I've watched enough Sci-fi movies to know this isn't going to end well for me", thought Ally to herself. She gets up, marches to the bathroom, fills a bucket with water, and marches back with her bucket in hand. The robot tries to flee, but it's too late. Ally dunks the water on the robot, short-circuiting it. " Well, that takes care of that", Ally thought to herself.
